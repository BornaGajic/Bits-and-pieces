## Chat-o-Tron :computer: :envelope: :computer:
A  local network messaging application. In Chat-o-Tron you can create or join any number of rooms for conversation which have one or more participants. My goal for this app is to have as many features as possible - my personal coding playground.

Current To-Dos:
 - Public/Private/Temporary rooms
 - Some sort of an account system
 - Make it run outside local network
 - Notes/Planning/Pool - client can use it in a room

At some point I'll put msi installer here.

## Memory
As the name suggests - this game is a memory game: pick two cards if they are the same you can try again.

## TickTackToe
Also a self explanatory game.

To-Dos:
 - Implement multiplayer within local network
 - Account/User system with miscellaneous statistics data
